# Daily_Quote_Splashing
DailyQuoteSplash is a Python application that extracts inspirational quotes from a user-specified PDF file and displays a new quote each time the computer starts.
Built using the Tkinter library for the graphical interface and PyPDF2 for PDF text extraction, this tool brings daily motivation right to your desktop. Ideal for personal productivity and positive reinforcement, DailyQuoteSplash runs silently in the background and displays a clean, quote window at startup.
